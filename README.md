# Amazon-Price-Tracker-Project-Objective
Recently there was an Amazon sale and I wanted to buy a product that I had been checking on for a long time. But, as I was ready to buy it I noticed that the price had increased and I wondered if the sale was even legitimate. So I figured by creating this price tracker app, it would not only increase my fluency in python but I would also have my very own home-brewed app to track amazon prices.

## Project-Checkpoints

- Accesing product description such as product title, product price.
- Running conditional statements to compare the product price with threshold price.
- Transforming the system as a source system to handle the tracking and sending emails.
- Sending the email to 1 or more customers daily, weekly or once the price reached to expected threshold price.
